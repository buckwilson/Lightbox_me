Zepto.lightbox_me.js
version 2.3z

Have you ever had a DOM element that you wanted lightboxed, but didn't want all the fanciness of all the lightbox-related plug-ins out there? Lightbox_me is for you.

Lightbox_me is an essential tool for the Zepto developer's toolbox. Feed it a DOM element wrapped in a Zepto object and it will lightbox it for you, no muss no fuss.

*Please note* this is a Zepto port of the plugin, it **will not** work with jQuery!


## Usage

Lightbox_me is a Zepto plugin and requires Zepto to be included in order to work.

Include both Zepto and the lightbox_me JavaScript file before calling the plugin in your JavaScript.

Invoke the lightbox by calling the plugin on a Zepto object:
$(dom).lightbox_me();

There are no animations in this version of the plugin, the overlay and modal are just shown and hidden, not faded.
